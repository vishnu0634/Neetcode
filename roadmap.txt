Duplicate:Initialise a list and in a for loop check if elements are in duplicate and then append.Return true if duplicate.Reture true if found once.
Anagram:If the lengths of s and t are different, they cannot be anagrams, so we return False immediately.countS.get(s[i], 0) retrieves the count of s[i] in countS, defaulting to 0 if it doesn't exist, and then increments it.
Two Sum:In the brute force approach ,take a nested for loop for i and j and check if nums[i] + nums[j] = target and return the indexs[i,j].
Group Anagram: We use a hashmap to solve this question where we are using it to map the count of each character to the list of anagrams given.There is one for loop to go through the strings in which we initialize the value of count to [0]*26 and another for loop to count the characters in each string(do this by subtracting ASCII value).
