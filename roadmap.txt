Duplicate:Initialise a list and in a for loop check if elements are in duplicate and then append.Return true if duplicate.Reture true if found once.
Anagram:If the lengths of s and t are different, they cannot be anagrams, so we return False immediately.countS.get(s[i], 0) retrieves the count of s[i] in countS, defaulting to 0 if it doesn't exist, and then increments it.
Two Sum:In the brute force approach ,take a nested for loop for i and j and check if nums[i] + nums[j] = target and return the indexs[i,j].
